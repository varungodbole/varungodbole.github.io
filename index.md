My name is Varun Godbole. 

I spent almost ten years at Google across a number of deep learning projects. A lot of that time was on the [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/) team, which later got re-orged into [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I spent five years working at the intersection of machine learning and medical imaging. I was a co-first author of the Nature paper [International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6). I also spent a few years working on code generation. In the pre-ChatGPT era, I spent time working on code completion for Google's internal IDE. See [this](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/07/ml-enhanced-code-completion-improves.html) blog post for more details. I later ended up being a core contributor to Gemini, and was on that project from its inception.

I've started writing a newsletter at www.varungodbole.com. In the last few years, I've started becoming increasingly interested in the ways in which we can use AI to think more clearly, to be wiser and overall more adapative in the world. I write about this and related ideas on substack.

## Office Hours

As a social experiment, I've also started doing office hours. Anyone on the internet can book 30 minutes with me via [this calendly URL](https://calendly.com/godbolevarun/30min). Please note that even if you book time with me, I may not have bandwidth to accept it at that specific time. We can likely figure it out!
